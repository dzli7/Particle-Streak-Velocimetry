# Particle-Streak-Velocimetry

Flow visualization is extremely important in fluid dynamics given the ubiquity of fluids and humanityâ€™s inability to view flow with the naked eye. However, many flow visualization techniques are either qualitative (i.e. dye visualization) or relatively slow (i.e. particle image velocimetry, takes hours to process). The principal objective of this project is to apply machine learning to implement quick, cheap, and quantitative flow visualization with Particle Streak Velocimetry (PSV). PSV is a novel method of flow measurement in which a laser is used to illuminate non-disruptive particles in a fluid, and the fluid is photographed such that the resulting image contains streak-like structures following the particle paths. By constructing and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), streaks within a window can be analyzed to predict average displacement and azimuth across the window. By breaking the image down into windows with overlap, this CNN can be applied to a full image of experimental or simulated data, producing the velocity field of an entire image. With optimization, this network has the potential to visualize flow in real time.
